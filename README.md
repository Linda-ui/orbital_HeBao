## Overview

For Milestone 3, we have implemented the API gateway plus two backend Kitex services. For each Kitex service, we created three duplicate instances (hosted on different ports) for testing purposes. 

The features we implemented includes:
1. **Service registration and discovery:** Nacos is integrated in our gateway as the service registry. Kitex service instances register their addresses on the Nacos server, and Kitex clients can discover these instances through the Nacos server to establish connections with the corresponding servers.

2. **Load balacing:** Kitex's default load balancer is integrated in our gateway so that loads (request traffics) can be evenly distributed on the three server instances created for each Kitex service. This feature is to prevent overloading and thus breakdown of any single service instance.

3. **IDL-service mapping and dynamic update:** our gateway maintains a dynamic map between each interface definition language (IDL) file and its corresponding Kitex service. When an IDL file describing a service is added/deleted, the map will update itself to reflect changes in the managed services of our gateway, even when the gateway is still running. The client would not face disruptions of the gateway service when the backend services are being added or deleted.
<br></br>

## Initialisation

First [download the latest version of Nacos](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/releases)

Then, run the gateway startup script to start up the API gateway and the nacos server locally.
```shell
# run at project root directory
./script/gateway_startup_zsh.sh # for zshell
# OR
./script/gateway_startup_bash.sh # for bash
```

To check if the API gateway is running.
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/

# should return "the api gateway is running"
```

To check if the Nacos server is running, log in at http://127.0.0.1:8848/nacos/index.html#/login with username `nacos` and password `nacos`.

Finally, run the backend server startup script to start up all service instances.
```shell
# run at project root directory
./script/server_startup.sh
```
<br></br>

## Integration test
The gateway is customised to handle business errors like invalid user requests. Depending on the user inputs, various error messages will be returned with corresponding error codes (in the form of a response).

Navigate to the `/integration_test` directory, and run the go tests in verbose mode to see all our integration testcases:
```shell
go test ./... -v
```

You can also test using cURL to view the exact response the gateway sends back for each of the request, we have provided the commands to send various valid/invalid requests in `scripts/echo_request.sh` and `scripts/sum_request.sh`. You can find the expected response in the comments for each request.
<br></br>
## Unit Test
Several chosen packages have unit tests done. Run the following commands to run all unit tests and check test coverage:
```shell
go test ./...
go test ./... -cover
```
<br></br>
## Testing the dynamic update feature during runtime of the gateway
First, start running the gateway and example servers `echo` and `sum`.
### Adding a service
The official documentation for creating a new Kitex service can be found [here](https://www.cloudwego.io/docs/kitex/getting-started/). You can also follow our instructions below for a simplified version of a service for testing. If you face any difficulties, please refer to the official doc for debugging.

Add an example `length` Kitex service that returns the length of the string input. You can also use another service with a different service name. 

Under the project root directory, create a new Thrift file that defines this service and is used for Kitex to generate skeleton code.
By convention, name it `length.thrift`.
```thrift
namespace go length

struct LengthReq {
  1: string msg
}

struct LengthResp {
  1: i64 msg
}

service LengthSvc {
  LengthResp LengthMethod(1: LengthReq req)
}
```
You can also add in other structs and service methods as needed.
After saving this file, use the Kitex compiler to compile the IDL file to generate whole project.
```
$ kitex -module github.com/Linda-ui/orbital_HeBao -service length length.thrift
```
After running the above command, you will see the generated project layout:
```
.
|-- build.sh
|-- length.thrift
|-- handler
|   `-- handler.go
|-- kitex_gen
|   `-- length
|       |-- lengthsvc
|       |   |-- client.go
|       |   |-- invoker.go
|       |   |-- lengthsvc.go
|       |   `-- server.go
|       |-- k-consts.go
|       |-- k-length.go
|       `-- length.go
|-- main.go
|-- kitex_info.yaml
`-- script
    `-- bootstrap.sh
```
Notice that there is not a subdirectory called `handler`. Please create that subdirectory yourself and put `handler.go` inside. Meanwhile, you should also change the package name of `handler.go` to be `handler`. This can be achieved by changing the first line of `handler.go`.

For cleaner code structure, place all the above generated file into a new subdirectory `length` under `kitex_services/`. Note that you may have to rewrite the import path of package `length` in all generated files with this import package. Skipping this step will not affect the correctness of code. For ease of illustration, the code below will be based on writing this service in the root directory.

All method process entry should be in `handler.go`. Below is an example implementation of the length service.
```go
package handler

import (
	"context"
	length "github.com/Linda-ui/orbital_HeBao/kitex_gen/length"
)

// LengthSvcImpl implements the last service interface defined in the IDL.
type LengthSvcImpl struct{}

// LengthMethod implements the LengthSvcImpl interface.
func (s *LengthSvcImpl) LengthMethod(ctx context.Context, req *length.LengthReq) (resp *length.LengthResp, err error) {
	return &length.LengthResp{Msg: int64(len(req.Msg))}, nil
}
```

Next, modify the `main.go` file so that it registers the service with Nacos, has a service name called "length", and uses a customised port number 8893. Should you decide to change this port number, avoid using ports already in use by the gateway and other services, or any other programs currently running on your laptop. By default, the gateway runs on port 8080, the echo service runs on ports 8870, 8871, 8872, the sum service runs on ports 9870, 9871, 9872.
```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net"

	length "github.com/Linda-ui/orbital_HeBao/kitex_gen/length/lengthsvc"
        handler "github.com/Linda-ui/orbital_HeBao/handler"
	"github.com/cloudwego/kitex/pkg/klog"
	"github.com/cloudwego/kitex/pkg/rpcinfo"
	"github.com/cloudwego/kitex/server"
	"github.com/kitex-contrib/registry-nacos/registry"
)

func main() {
	r, err := registry.NewDefaultNacosRegistry()
	if err != nil {
		klog.Fatal(err)
	}

	svr := length.NewServer(
		new(handler.LengthSvcImpl),
		server.WithRegistry(r),
		server.WithServerBasicInfo(&rpcinfo.EndpointBasicInfo{ServiceName: "length"}),
		server.WithServiceAddr(&net.TCPAddr{IP: net.IPv4(127, 0, 0, 1), Port: 8893}),
	)

	err = svr.Run()

	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err.Error())
	}
}
```
Next, run `main` to get the server running.
```shell
go run main.go
```
You should see the below message:
```shell

```
You have successfully ran the Kitex server for the length service.
In order for our gateway to recognise our newly added service, move `length.thrift` into the `idl/` subdirectory. 

Test this new service through the gateway by:  
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/gateway/length/LengthMethod \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"msg":"hello"}' \
    -w '\n'
```
You should see:
```shell
{"err_code":0,"err_message":"success","msg":5}
```
Congratulations! You have just added a new Kitex service to the gateway while it is still running, leveraging the dynamic update feature.
<br></br>

### Change the service logic
Modify the logic in `handler.go`:
```go
func (s *LengthSvcImpl) LengthMethod(ctx context.Context, req *length.LengthReq) (resp *length.LengthResp, err error) {
	return &length.LengthResp{Msg: int64(len(req.Msg)) * 5}, nil
}
```

Kill the service listening on port 8893 (on Linux and MacOS)ï¼š
```shell
lsof -t -i :8893 | xargs kill
```

Restart the server:
```shell
go run main.go
```

Perform a test to the updated `length` service:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/gateway/length/LengthMethod \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"msg":"hello"}' \
    -w '\n'
```
You should see:
```shell
{"err_code":0,"err_message":"success","msg":25}
```
<br></br>

### Deleting a service
Simply remove the `length.thrift` from the `idl/` subdirectory, and clean up the rest of the generated server code by deleting all the files.
Perform a test to the deleted `length` service:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/gateway/length/LengthMethod \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"msg":"hello"}' \
    -w '\n'
```
You should see:
```shell
{"err_code":10002,"err_message":"server not found"}
```
