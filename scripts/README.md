## Scripts
The `echo_request.sh` and `sum_reqiest.sh` files are terminal commands that send various valid/invalid requests to the gateway. They can be used as a quick test to our gateway and its error handling feature.

The `server_startup.sh` script is used to start up the backend servers. However, do not run this file, instead, run `make services` at the project root directory.
